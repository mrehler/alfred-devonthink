# alfred-devonthink

Simple Alfred workflow for interacting with DEVONthink

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a fork that just fixes the call to DT3 to update it for DT4. I don't know how to do anything else. The Auto Update won't look for any further things from this repo, it's still pointed at the old repo

## Usage

- `ds` to search DEVONthink
- `dn` to create a new DEVONthink note

This workflow also provides a 'Import to DEVONthink' file action for quickly adding files to the DEVONthink inbox

## Installing

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/dvcrn/alfred-devonthink/releases).

The workflow will auto-update itself if a new version becomes available. (You can disable this by deleting the 'Auto Update' node)
